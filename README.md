 A simple WPF application that tracks animes your watching.

There are 4 options in the dropdown: Currently Watching, Up To Date, Finished, and Queue.

In each category you can add animes and order them.

The current information supported is a Name, Season Count, Episode Count, and a url.  The url also comes with a watch button.
